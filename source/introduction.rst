Introduction
============

The Battlerite Game Data Service makes it easier for users to have open access to in-game data, which developers can use to build awesome tools and services!

This service is designed to implement the required features of the `JSON-API <http://jsonapi.org/>`_ specification.

Throughout this documentation we show example language bindings using CURL, and plan to add libraries for Ruby, NodeJS, Java, Python, and more. Community contributions are welcome, and rewarded with good karma (and swag!).


Versioning
---------------------------

We follow `SEMVER <http://semver.org/>`_ standards, using a MAJOR.MINOR.PATCH versioning scheme. This means that we will increment versioning in the following way:

* MAJOR version when we make incompatible API changes
* MINOR version when we add functionality in a backwards-compatible manner
* PATCH version when we make backwards-compatible bug fixes

You can see the current version and deploy date by viewing the Status endpoint.
