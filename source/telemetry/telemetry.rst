Telemetry
=========

The telemtry provides us insights into the match. It gives us details of various events that happened in the match alongwith the time when they happened. Some of the events also have location which can be plotted on a Vainglory Game map. Telemtry is very useful to generate a timeline visualtions of how the match went for replays, or create heatmaps of where a certin hero or ability is most useful. These are just some of the exmaples of where Telemtry can be used.


To get Telemetry Data
---------------------------


You start by pulling a list of matches using the matches endopoint.

The HTTP Request to get matches is ``GET https://api.dc01.gamelockerapp.com/shards/na/matches``

**Shell**

.. code-block:: shell

  curl "https://api.dc01.gamelockerapp.com/shards/na/matches" \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer <api-key>" \
  -H "Accept: application/vnd.api+json"

  *The above command returns JSON structured like this:*

   "data": [
    {
      "type": "match",
      "id": "f5373c40-0aa9-11e7-bcff-0667892d829e",
      "attributes": {
        "createdAt": "2017-03-17T00:38:00Z",
        "duration": 259,
        "gameMode": "blitz_pvp_ranked",
        "patchVersion": "",
        "shardId": "na",
        "stats": {
          "endGameReason": "victory",
          "queue": "blitz_pvp_ranked"
        },
        "titleId": "semc-vainglory"
      },
      "relationships": {
        "assets": {
          "data": [
            {
              "type": "asset",
              "id": "b900c179-0aaa-11e7-bb12-0242ac110005"
            }
          ]
        },
        "rosters": {
          "data": [
            {
              "type": "roster",
              "id": "b8f6640a-0aaa-11e7-bb12-0242ac110005"
            },
            {
              "type": "roster",
              "id": "b8f65271-0aaa-11e7-bb12-0242ac110005"
            }
          ]
        },
        "rounds": {
          "data": []
        }
      }
    },

    *You need to look for Assets JSON node which points to telemetry. Check for the following in the response:*

    "relationships": {
        "assets": {
          "data": [
            {
              "type": "asset",
              "id": "b900c179-0aaa-11e7-bb12-0242ac110005"
            }
          ]
        },

    *Once you have located this ID, you now have to search for the following JSON segment in the response object. The following response object will provide you a link to the Telemtry data*

    {
      "type": "asset",
      "id": "b900c179-0aaa-11e7-bb12-0242ac110005",

        "contentType": "application/json",
        "createdAt": "2017-03-17T00:43:22Z",
        "description": "",
        "filename": "telemetry.json",
        "name": "telemetry"
      }
    },

    *You can download the data with following commands. Please note that you do not need API Key to get this data.*

 	 -H "Accept: application/vnd.api+json"
